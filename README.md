# ShareSphere

## Project Description

ShareSphere is a decentralized Web3 platform that enables users to share their interests with friends through videos, songs, images, and other digital content. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, ShareSphere provides a censorship-resistant and transparent way to discover, share, and interact with content while maintaining user ownership and control.

The platform allows users to register with unique usernames, share various types of content (videos, audio, images, links), and engage with the community through a liking system. All interactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a decentralized social sharing ecosystem where:

- **User Ownership**: Users have complete control over their shared content and data
- **Censorship Resistance**: No central authority can remove or censor user content
- **Transparent Engagement**: All likes, shares, and interactions are publicly verifiable on the blockchain
- **Community-Driven**: The platform evolves based on community needs and governance
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Seamless sharing of content from various sources and platforms
